# hacam-lib-rs

A Rust cross-platform userspace driver for interacting with the Huawei EnVizion 360Â° Camera (Huawei CV60).

## Platform support

Tested on Windows and macOS. Should work on Linux as well. 
This library uses the [nusb](https://github.com/kevinmehall/nusb) library.
The camera itself uses a standard LibUSB driver, so it works out of the box on macOS, but you need to select the driver manually on Windows (WinUSB).

## Examples

Examples are provided in the `examples` directory.
