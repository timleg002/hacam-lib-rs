# hacam-lib-rs

A Rust cross-platform userspace driver for interacting with the Huawei EnVizion 360Â° Camera (Huawei CV60).

## Platform support

Tested on Windows and macOS. Should work on Linux as well. 
The camera uses a standard LibUSB driver, so it works out of the box on macOS, 
but you need to select the driver manually on Windows (WinUSB).

## Examples
